# Overview

In this project, you will build a Github repository from scratch and create a scaffolding that will assist you in performing both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. You'll use Github Actions along with a Makefile, requirements.txt and application code to perform an initial lint, test, and install cycle. Next, you'll integrate this project with Azure Pipelines to enable Continuous Delivery to Azure App Service.

## Project Plan

It is critical to have an effective project plan and task tracking, In this section you find:
* A [trello](https://trello.com/b/7QrYdgzR/udacity-building-a-ci-cd-pipeline) board for the project
* A spreadsheet that includes the original and final project plan

## Instructions

<TODO:  
* Architectural Diagram (Shows how key parts of the system work)>

in Azure Cloud Shell, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:A-Janad/ci-cd-pipeline-udacity.git
```

* Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines.  [Note the official documentation should be referred to and double checked as you setup CI/CD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp?view=azure-devops).

* Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell.  [Use this file as a template for the deployed prediction](https://github.com/udacity/nd082-Azure-Cloud-DevOps-Starter-Code/blob/master/C2-AgileDevelopmentwithAzure/project/starter_files/flask-sklearn/make_predict_azure_app.sh).
The output should look similar to this:

```bash
udacity@Azure:~$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[20.35373177134412]}
```

* Output of streamed log files from deployed application
